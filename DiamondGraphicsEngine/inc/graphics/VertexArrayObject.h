    // A Vertex Array Object (VAO) is an OpenGL 3 construct which helps simplify
    // the drawing process with VBOs and IBOs. This is a gross understatement for
    // the capabilities of a VAO, but this framework keeps its usage of them
    // simple. We use them because, with a few extra initialization steps, we are
    // able to very easily render objects with just 3 OpenGL calls (bind VAO,
    // render, unbind). For the simplification of the framework, consider a VAO to
    // be a container of a VBO, IBO, and what's known as vertex layout
    // information. Vertex layout information is described in more detail in the
    // implementation of VertexArrayObject::Build. You do not need to worry about
    // manually constructing VBOs and IBOs; you just need to construct one VAO.
    // You can then populate the IBO and VBO of the VAO with indexes and vertices,
    // then build the VAO (which, in turn, builds the VBO and IBO). It is then
    // ready to render. See VertexBufferObject.h and IndexBufferObject.h for more
    // information on VBOs and IBOs, respectively.

        // does not necessarily have to be the same program used to render it. This
