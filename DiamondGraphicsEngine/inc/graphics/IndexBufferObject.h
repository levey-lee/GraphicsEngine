  // index buffer object is an element array (GL_ELEMENT_ARRAY_BUFFER) stored
  // within a buffer (glGenBuffers/glDeleteBuffers). Despite being referred to
  // as an element array, when it's stored within a buffer it is more commonly
  // known as an index buffer object, or IBO for short.
  // IBOs store indexes within a mesh, rather than actual vertex data. Each
  // index is used as a lookup value within the VBO (see VertexBufferObject.h
  // for more) when rendering the mesh. VertexArrayObject.h has more
  // information on how these two structures are used to render geometry.
