  // A ShaderProgram is a wrapper around the GLSL shader objects stored within
  // OpenGL. Shader programs on the GPU are lightweight applications that fill
  // in functionality within the transformation and rasterization pipelines of
  // the GPU. They essentially represent the low-level code written in CS200,
  // but now that code is being executed on the GPU itself. Since it's a
  // different architecture and processor, interacting with that application is
  // much more complicated than any CPU-side C/C++ application. This class
  // helps to simplify that interaction process, but you will want to have a
  // good understanding of how the transformation/rasterization process works
  // on the GPU before trying to understand this interface. ShaderProgram.cpp
  // goes into greater depth on what an OpenGL shader program actually is, as
  // well as the OpenGL code needed to work with it. For more information on
  // building one of these classes yourself, see:
