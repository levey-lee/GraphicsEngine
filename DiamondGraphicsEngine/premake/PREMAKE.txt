You should not have to worry much about using premake. Simply run build to
generate a Visual Studio solution. You can build and run the project from within
Visual Studio. Before submitting, run clean.bat to cleanup any build artifacts.
If you changed your premake script for whatever reason, please leave a remark
in your README.txt explaining what you changed and why. Also, please do not 
include the sample folder when creating your archive.
